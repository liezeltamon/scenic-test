  - All results from analyses subdividing into subdirectories e.g. figures/, tables/
  - As in data/, arrange chronologically e.g. using subdirectories with dates as recommended in (Noble, 2009)
  - Per subdirectory (an analysis / experiment), have either a README.md that records every step or a driver script that can carry out entire analysis automatically
